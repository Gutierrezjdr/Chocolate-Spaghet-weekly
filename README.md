# Chocolate Spaghet's weekly blogs

This repositoyry belongs to Andrey Shtukenberg and contains weekly blogs accounting for my Open Source adventures and activities. The goal is to contribute as much as possible to the open source community and projects in the period of time I'm given.

[Here](https://hunter-college-cs-ossd.github.io/Chocolate-Spaghet-weekly/) is a link to the blog! It's completely written by me.
###### Enjoy!
