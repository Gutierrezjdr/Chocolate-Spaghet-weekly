### Wikipedia, disambiguity, and humann behavior

Hello once again,

This week's task was to lift up some dust and take a closer look at what Wikipedia is and how it treats its own. A preface to the story I am going to be talking about here. [Catalina Cruz](https://www.cruzfornewyork.com/meet-catalina/) is a candidate running for an assembly spot in New York State. Unfortunately, she has the same name as the porn-star Catalina Cruz, which is highly damaging to any career, especially if one doesn't have a Wikipedia page to clear up the confusion. During March 2018, Wikipedia editors had a lengthy debate on the topic of creation of such a page and a disambiguity page, which shows up all Wikipedia searches when the search is too ambiguous. One of the senior editors of Wikipedia noticed that these were created and decided to take it upon himself to delete these pages.

Here's the problem. If one editor can control the fate of any page being created, is Wikipedia really the information site everbody should be looking at? The ability to singlehandedly bring down and close off important information and give different treatment is just too much power for a platform that works like a hive mind. Besides, the reasoning described on [this page]() can be applied to more people than just Catalina Cruz page, yet this is the one under *this* kind of attention. It is imperative that Wikipedia should change their policies regarding editorial powers and admining, or it will loose its status as a reliable source of information, however weak it may be.
