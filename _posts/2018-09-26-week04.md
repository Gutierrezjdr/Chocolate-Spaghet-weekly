# Just the gist of git

This is the weekly blog-post for week 4 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week was a quite short assignment, appropriately so for the amount of other work that *still* needs to be done. I don't know wether or not it's my fault, but I feel like git is very clumsy and while logical, not extremely user friendly.
