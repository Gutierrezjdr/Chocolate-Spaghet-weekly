### Just the gist of git

This is the weekly blog-post for week 4 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This week was a quite short assignment, appropriately so for the amount of other work that *still* needs to be done. I don't know wether or not it's my fault, but I feel like git is *fairly* clumsy, however, fairly logical and user friendly.

I look at the instructions, realize that I know nothing about git, and head straight to the book. If not for the book, then Google would definitely help me, but it was of great help in my future ventures. Heading into the terminal, I didn't really expect much to work, but I was happily mistaken. With a few hitches here and there I got to the end of the task and relished in the confirmation email sent by the instructor. **Hazzah!**

Something I noticed while working on this little exercise is how little room for error there is, or at least it feels like it. `git commit` sounds just as final as a judge sentencing you for jaywalking when you were crossing the street on the zebra. Every step you get paranoid and make you double check everything, at least that's that *I felt*. Either way, time pushes on, and there are places to be and things to do.

> Thank you for reading!
