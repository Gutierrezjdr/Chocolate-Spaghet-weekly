### Projects and other things.

This is the weekly blog-post for week 5 of 14.

#### Hello there,

This is going to be a much shorter post than usual. This week we didn't have any deadline for this Wednesday, but we still do have an assignment. The assignment numbering system is now off from the week numbers.

Last weekend I went to a [HackNY hackathon](https://hackny.org/hackathon/), and my team and I have created an [application](http://myce.link.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html), and while writing this post I realized that it is pretty much an open source application. Most of its code is available through [the repository](https://github.com/Ishmaelk/Myce), with the small exception of some backend things. The keys for some APIs will be required for it to run, but pretty much anybody in North America can make this on their local machine and run it, the only difference between our project and an open source one is the license. Let me end this shameless promotion plug by saying that the project is great and you should definitely check it out.

In other words, nothing exciting has happened this week, and I will see you next week with the new assignment deadline.

> Thank you for reading!
